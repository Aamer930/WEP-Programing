    What is Meant by AARU ?
</h1>
<p id="HomeP1">
    AARU  is the name for heavenly paradise in Egyptian mythology. 
    Ruled over by Osiris, an Egyptian god, the location has been described as the ka of the Nile Delta.In Ancient Egypt, the afterlife held deep significance, with the soul's journey meticulously guided by intricate beliefs. Central to this was the "Weighing of the Heart," where a person's heart was weighed against the feather of Maat, representing truth. Those deemed righteous embarked on a perilous journey through guarded gates to reach Aaru, a paradise in the east with reed-covered islands. Here, they found eternal peace and pleasure, while Osiris presided over the "field of offerings." This succinctly encapsulates the profound spirituality and symbolism of Ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife.
