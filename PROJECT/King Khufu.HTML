    King Khufu is considered one of the most important kings who ruled Egypt during the ancient Egyptian period. He ruled Egypt from 2589 B.C to 2566 B.C during the old kingdom of Egypt (2686-2150 BC). He was the son of king Seneferu and Queen Hetepheres, and succeeded his father on the throne of Egypt and became the second king of the 4th dynasty. He married two queens by the name of Merities & Henutsen and had nine sons and fifteen daughters.
